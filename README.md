# Eigen_Projection_Function

This package is  mainly based on two articles:

- [minimum distance matrix](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4981212)

- [decrease distance matrix](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4997292)

You can install this package through `pip`:


`pip install -e . `

for developers.

I hope you can new a python3 environment via `virtualenv` or other ways, so that there will not appears some incompatible problems
